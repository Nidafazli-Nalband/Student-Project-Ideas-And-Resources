## 🤔 Stuck on What to Build?

Every student reaches a point where motivation exists but **ideas don’t**.  
Project Hub exists to remove that friction.

This repository provides **clear, realistic, and buildable project ideas** that help you:
- Strengthen core coding skills 🧠
- Explore tools & technologies safely 🧪
- Build portfolio-ready projects 📁
- Gain confidence for interviews 🎯
- Avoid over-complicated or fake projects ❌

Each idea is intentionally **student-sized** — not toy apps, not enterprise monsters.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find Here

Every project idea includes:
1. A **clear goal** (what you’re building and why)
2. **Core features** (minimum viable scope)
3. Optional **enhancements** (to grow skills)
4. Suggested **tech stack**
5. Learning **resources & references**

You are encouraged to extend, remix, and improve ideas.
